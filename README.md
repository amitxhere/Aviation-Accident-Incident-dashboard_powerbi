## 💡 Insights & Outcomes 
This dashboard provides a holistic overview of global aviation accident and incident data spanning more than two decades. By combining visual analytics with key safety metrics, it offers valuable insights into flight safety trends, operational risks, and regional accident distributions.

Between **2000 and 2021**, the aviation industry recorded **100 crashes**, involving **15,400 passengers**. Of these, **7,800 fatalities** and **7,600 survivors** were reported, resulting in an **average survival rate of 50.32%**. This data reveals that, while air travel incidents do occur, survival outcomes have significantly improved due to advancements in aircraft safety and emergency protocols.

The **Crash by Year** and **Death in Year** trends illustrate fluctuations in aviation incidents, with noticeable spikes around certain years, suggesting possible global or regional factors. The **Aircraft Type Analysis** identifies aircraft models with relatively higher fatalities, such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, providing valuable input for manufacturers and safety investigators.

The **Operator Performance** section highlights airlines with the best survival outcomes, where **British Airways** and **Air France** show higher-than-average survival rates. In contrast, some carriers demonstrate areas for improvement in emergency response effectiveness. Meanwhile, the **Continental Fatalities Distribution** indicates that most incidents occurred in **Europe** and **North America**, correlating with their high flight traffic.

At the country level, **Germany**, **Brazil**, and **France** reported the highest fatalities, while **India**, **Russia**, and the **USA** remain among the top five nations by total crashes. These insights assist aviation authorities and policy-makers in identifying high-risk regions and implementing targeted safety measures.

Overall, this dashboard serves as a data-driven tool for aviation analysts, enabling deeper exploration of safety metrics, trend forecasting, and operational benchmarking. It provides clarity, transparency, and actionable intelligence — crucial for enhancing global aviation safety standards.
